Prediction Workflow
========================

The intention of the prediction workflow is to use a variety of transcript evidence, from short reads and long reads
based gene assemblies, protein alignments, homology alignments and other evidence such as expression, introns and
repeats to generate gene predictions ab initio and evidence based gene predictions.
